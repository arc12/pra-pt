# Precision, Recall, Accuracy (and Cost/Benefit)
_This documents the configuration files which allow the Plaything to be customised and notes how they relate to various useage scenarios._

Plaything name: pra

## Plaything Specification
Refer to the README in the pg_shared repository/folder for common elements; this README refers only to the elements which are specific to the Precision/Recall/Accuracy Plaything.
The Specifications folder is Config/pra.

Available views:
- "simulate"
- "about"

### "detail"
All are either simple text or a numerical value, except where noted.
- context_info: text shown under heading (heading is the "title" of the plaything)
- start_curve: a key from the "rocs" asset. If not set, the first curve will be used
- start_class_fraction_pc: initial value for the class fraction slider (note this is a % value, e.g. 50)
- start_specificity: initial value for the specificity slider (note this is >=0 and < 1)
- with_cb_value" [boolean]: whether to show the checkbox to include cost/benefit value settings and calculation.
- scatter_grid_size [integer]: the dimension of the plot which visualises the true/false positive/negative distribution. This is also used as the number of items used in the precision/recall/accuracy and cost/benefit calculations. A typical value is 10. Values much about 30 will not look good with the current style.
- class_fraction_label: label to show on the class fraction slider. e.g. "Positive Fraction (%)"
- specificity_label: label for the specificity slider (i.e. 1 - false positive rate)
- tp, fp, tn, fn: text to use for true positive etc. I omitted, "TP" etc will be shown.
- cb_tp, cb_fp, cb_tn, cb_fn: default values to show for the costs/benefits associated with a true positive etc. Negative values are costs.
cb_units: currency unit (etc) to show before the total cost/benefit. e.g. "Â£". The default is no unit.

### "asset_map"
Keys in __asset_map__:
- about - a markdown file. This does not support placeholder substitution.
- rocs - a JSON file containing a set of ROC curves as produced by the "ROC Curve Sim" notebook.

The rocs JSON entries look like (x is the FP rate and y is the TP rate), noting that the x value associated with the first y entry is x = x_step and the last y entry should correspond with x = 1.0:
```
"A": {"x_step": 0.01, "y": [0.018, 0.037, 0.055, 0.073, 0.091, 0.109, 0.126, 0.144, 0.162, 0.179, 0.196, 0.214, 0.231, 0.247, 0.264, 0.28, 0.297, 0.313, 0.329, 0.344, 0.36, 0.375, 0.39, 0.405, 0.419, 0.433, 0.447, 0.461, 0.474, 0.487, 0.5, 0.513, 0.525, 0.537, 0.548, 0.559, 0.57, 0.58, 0.59, 0.6, 0.609, 0.619, 0.628, 0.638, 0.647, 0.656, 0.666, 0.675, 0.684, 0.693, 0.702, 0.711, 0.72, 0.729, 0.738, 0.746, 0.755, 0.764, 0.772, 0.781, 0.789, 0.797, 0.805, 0.813, 0.821, 0.829, 0.836, 0.844, 0.851, 0.859, 0.866, 0.873, 0.88, 0.886, 0.893, 0.899, 0.906, 0.912, 0.918, 0.924, 0.929, 0.935, 0.94, 0.945, 0.95, 0.955, 0.959, 0.964, 0.968, 0.972, 0.976, 0.979, 0.983, 0.986, 0.989, 0.991, 0.994, 0.996, 0.998, 1.0]}
